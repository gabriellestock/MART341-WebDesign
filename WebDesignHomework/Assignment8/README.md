## Div
    I used a lot of divs within my assignment. I used them to organize each section of my page, for example, my different makeup tutorials, my audio, and my podcast. Using divs helped me with balance and structure.
## Span
    I used a <span> to highlight the text within my paragraphs, drawing attention to key details of the tutorials I provided. 
## Audio 
    I used a free audio file for baxckground music for people to listen to while doing their skincare.
## Video
    I used a hero video, which one can see right as they enter my tutorials page. It is on a loop so it plays over and over again. 
## Iframe
    I used an iframe to include a podcast video that I recommend and often listen to.
## Class
    To ensure uniform formatting throughout the navigation bar, I styled the navigation links using the class nav. I organized the audio and podcastÂ portions using the class media-item, using the same alignment and spacing styles.
## Escape character 
    The escape character is used on my page as a copyright at the bottom of the page. However, I obviously do not have a copyright.
