The idea that I have chosen to develop form last week is a personal skincare and beauty blog. I chose to develope this idea further because I feel like it is the topic in which I am most interested in and that I would actually continue to pursue outside of this class. I plan on using more of a casual and playful tone so people feel welcomed to my blog and feel like they can trust me.
