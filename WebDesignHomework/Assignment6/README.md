The idea that I have chosen to develop form last week is a personal skincare and beauty blog. I chose to develope this idea further because I feel like it is the topic in which I am most interested in and that I would actually continue to pursue outside of this class. I plan on using more of a casual and playful tone so people feel welcomed to my blog and feel like they can trust me.

<strong>How did adjusting width or background color help improve your layout?</strong>
- Adjusting the width took me a few tries, but once I got the hang of it it was very helpful with balancing images on my website. At first, my images were not centered, but once I included the width I was able to center the images to my liking.

<strong>How did your final design compare to your initial idea? Did the balance and layout turn out as expected, or did you have to make adjustments along the way?</strong>
- My initial idea was to create a girly website that looked inviting. I tried my best to create the color scheme I was looking for and I am happy with how that turned out, however, my images were not aligning how I wanted them to. I had to make several adjustments using width and margin codes to align the images to my liking.

<strong>If you experimented with float and margin, please tell me about your experience.</strong>
- Before I discoverred how to use margin, I was very frustrated. After including it in my code, I was able to balance my website to my liking with the limited knowledge I have so far.

<strong>Additionally, reflect on any challenges you faced during this assignment and how you overcame them. Did you encounter any issues with balancing content or using CSS? How did you solve them?</strong>
- I had a lot of challenges with figuring out the coloring and balance of my website. To overcome these issues, I used the index.html page provided to us by the professor to get a gist of how she conducted her website. I also relied a lot on going back to the external website for how to do semantic markup and lists.
