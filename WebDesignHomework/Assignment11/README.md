# Assignment 11 - Web Development Techniques

## HTML Page:
For this assignment, I will be working on the **story.html** page. This page will highlight the background story of the imaginary client, "Glow Up Skincare," a brand that provides natural beauty and skincare products.

## Required Techniques:
1. **External CSS Style Sheet**:
   - I created an external CSS style sheet to separate the styles from the HTML structure. This promotes better organization and makes it easier to maintain the styling.

2. **Hover Effects**:
   - I added hover effects on buttons and links to provide interactivity. This enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback on clickable elements.

3. **Self-Hosted Font**:
   - I selected a custom font and self-hosted it to maintain consistency in the brandâ€™s visual identity. The font is stored in the `assets/fonts` folder, and linked in the CSS file.

4. **Font from a Library**:
   - I used **Google Fonts** to incorporate an external font (e.g., "Roboto" or "Lora") to enhance the aesthetic and readability of the page.

## Additional Techniques:
1. **Experimenting with Different Font Styles**:
   - I played around with different font styles like `italic` and `oblique` to emphasize certain sections of the text, like product descriptions or special announcements.

2. **Adjusting Font-Weight**:
   - I used `font-weight` to create a hierarchy within the text. Headlines are bolded to stand out, and the body text is set to normal weight for readability.

3. **Text Decoration**:
   - I used `text-decoration` to add underlines to links and remove them from elements that are not links. This helps improve the clarity of which elements are interactive.

4. **Spacing Adjustments**:
   - I adjusted `line-height` to improve readability by giving more space between lines of text, and `letter-spacing` was used for headings to give a more polished look.

5. **Text Alignment**:
   - I aligned the text in the header and footer sections using `text-align: center` to create a clean and consistent layout.

6. **Pseudo-elements and Pseudo-classes**:
   - I used pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after` to insert decorative content before or after certain elements, such as quotation marks or icons in the navigation.

## Conclusion:
The techniques above were implemented to create a visually appealing, interactive, and well-organized web page for the brand "Glow Up Skincare."
