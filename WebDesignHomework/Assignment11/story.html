    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Founded in 2024, Glow Up Skincare was born out of a passion for natural beauty and a love to enhance that beauty through a wide-range of makeup options. Our founder, Gabrielle Stock, realized the need for a blog that intrdouces and teaches the concept of good skincare and how to manage it while also allows for the fun aspect of makeup, because every girl wants to look her best AND feel her best.

    <p>
      Our mission is to create effective posts that teach about the fundamentals of skincare and the importance of certain products.
    <p>
      At Glow Up!, we are dedicated to providing informative, honest, and practical beauty advice for every individual. Our mission is to inspire self-love and confidence by offering expert guidance on skincare routines, product recommendations, and the latest beauty trends. We strive to create a community that celebrates diversity, sustainability, and the beauty of authenticity. Through our blog, we aim to educate our readers on how to care for their skin with simple, effective, and eco-friendly products, allowing them to glow from the inside out.
