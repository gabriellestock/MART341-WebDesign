            <p>As part of my Business Systems Analysis and Design class, we were tasked with developing a website that aligned with our client's design specifications. Our group competed with others to create a website that would ultimately be selected by the client as their new online presence. We had the opportunity to collaborate with Partners In Home Care, a local non-profit organization, to bring their vision for a dream website to life. I took the lead in designing and editing the website for our team, and the client ended up incorporating many of our design elements into their final website!<a href="https://lauramclague.wixsite.com/partnersinhomecare"> View my group's website here</a>.</p>
