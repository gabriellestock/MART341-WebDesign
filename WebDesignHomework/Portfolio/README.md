# Marketing Portfolio

**Page Name**: portfolio.html

## Implemented Techniques

1. **Sizing**: Sizing is controlled using max-width, such as in .container {maxp-width: 1000px;} and main { max-width: 800px}, which constrains the width of elements to prevent them from becoming too wide on large screens.
2. **Overflow**: Used overflow in .container to ensure no content overflows container the boundaries.
3. **Border**: Borders are used to emphasize elements, such as in '.portfolio-item', which adds a subtle border around each portfolio item, enhancing separation and giving a card-like appearance.
4. **Margin**: Margin creates space outside elements, helping to separate sections. For example, margin: 0 auto; in .container centers the container on the page. 
5. **Padding**: Padding is applied to create space inside elements between content and borders, enhancing readability. For example, padding: 20px; in section and main provides inner space around content.
6. **Display**: Used display: inline-block for nav a links to place them horizontally in the navigation. 
7. **Position**: Used Position: relative to enable positioning relative to itself.
