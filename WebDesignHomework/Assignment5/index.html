<h3>Personal Skincare & Beauty Blog<h3>
    <p>For my personal blog website I would create a vibrant skincare and beauty blog where readers can explore skincare routines, product reviews, and makeup tutorials. I would create a colorful and fun design with features such as tips for better skincare and makeup. I would want to incorporate videos, quirky write-ups and humor to make skincare and beauty fun!</p>

<h3>Favorite Books journal </h3>
    <p>For this website idea, I would create a website highlighting all the books I have read. I would describe each book, why I liked it, and how I rated it. I would create a section on the website for people to respond to my reviews and allow them to also share hoe they're thoughts and feelings about the books. I would want the tone of this website to be warm and inviting for those who like to read.</p>
