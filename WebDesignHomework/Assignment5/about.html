<h1> Why I Chose These Three Website ideas</h1>

<hr />

<h3>Personal Skincare & Beauty Blog</h3>
    <p>I chose a skincare and beauty blog because of my passion for self-care, my love for exploring/testing new products, and my desire to share my own tips and routines with others. I want to helo others feel confident in their own skin.</p>

<hr />

<h3>College tips blog </h3>
    <p>I chose to possibly make a college tips and help blog because, as a senior, I feel like there are a lot of things I wish I had known going into my freshman year. I enjoy helping and mentoring others and hope I could do that through my blog.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Favorite books journal</h3>
    <p>I would want to create a journal about my favorite books and my ratings of each book because it is one of my passions. I love to read and I would also love to hear about what others have to say.</p>
