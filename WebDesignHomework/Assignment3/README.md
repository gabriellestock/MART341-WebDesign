# Reflections on this Cycle's Work
## Summary of my progress
During this cycle, I primarily focused on getting a handle on how to create new files for each assignment I will do this semester, and how to create a **README** file written in *markdown*. I encountered some issues such as accidentally creating my Assignment3 as a file instead of a folder. I was at first confused but then recounted last week's work and remembered how I created my Assignment2 folder. 
### Key Challenges Faced 
- Creating a README file within an assignment folder
- Creating an assignment folder
- Navigating through different folders and files
#### What I learned
I learned how to structure *folders* and *files* in a way that makes the project easier to navigate. This will be useful in larger projects where keeping things organized is essential.
