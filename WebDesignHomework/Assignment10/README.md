# Glow Up! Skincare Essentials

This project provides a single-page website showcasing skincare essentials and a skin type quiz. It's created as part of Assignment10 with specific requirements for HTML structure and an external stylesheet.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the site.
- **style/style.css**: External stylesheet that manages the siteâ€™s styling.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Techniques Used

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML is structured with headings, paragraphs, a product gallery, and a form to engage users.
2. **CSS for Styling**: 
   - The `style.css` file includes colors, fonts, and layout settings.
   - Flexbox is used in `.product-gallery` for responsive image display.
3. **Form and Input**: Created a skin type quiz form with fields for user responses, improving user interaction.
4. **Responsive Design**: Elements like the product images and form fields adapt for mobile and desktop views.
5. **External CSS**: Moved styles to an external `style.css` file, simplifying the HTML and improving maintainability.

## Setup and Usage

2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the page.
