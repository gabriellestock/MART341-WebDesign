# Project Overview

I worked on my index.html and products.html from my previous assignments.

## Required Techniques 
- **External CSS**: External stylesheet that manages the siteâ€™s styling.
- **Class selector**: Used to group and style the entire section introduing the blog's purpose. The intro-text class is specifically applied to the paragraph within that section to potentially apply distinct styles (like font size, color, or margin) that differentiate it from other paragraphs.
- **ID Selector**: Allows for specific styling or scripting targeted to the header section. 

## Additional Techniques

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML is structured with headings, paragraphs, a product gallery, and a form to engage users.
2. **CSS for Styling**: 
   - The `style.css` file includes colors, fonts, and layout settings.
3. **Form and Input**: Created a skin type quiz form with fields for user responses, improving user interaction.
4. **Responsive Design**: Elements like the product images and form fields adapt for mobile and desktop views.
5. **External CSS**: Moved styles to an external `style.css` file, simplifying the HTML and improving maintainability.
