                <h2>How to Perfect Your Winged Eyeliner</h2>
                <p>
                    Are you tired of messing up your entire makeup look just because of one step? 
                    One step in the whole routine that can either <strong>absolutely</strong> make or break your entire makeup look. 
                    Would you believe me if I told you it's way easier than it looks? Probably not because I am just some random girl obsessed with makeup. 
                    But, I think you should trust me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The phrase I say is, "The best way to get the best eyeliner is to not use it at all!" That may sound confusing, but it's true. 
                    The only way I can ever achieve my perfect wing is when I do not use eyeliner. Now, that may be because I'm not a makeup artist, 
                    and eyeliner stresses me out because it's typically really hard to erase and there is little room for forgiveness. 
                    But, this is exactly why I am sitting here writing this blog. I am not here to give you unrealistic tips that only a makeup artist could complete. 
                    I am here to give you realistic tips that you can incorporate into your daily makeup routine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, if I don't use eyeliner, then what do I use, you may ask? Eyeshadow. A product that is very forgiving but also lasts! 
                    The pictures below are the exact products I use to create my wing. The eyeshadow palette is the Master Mattes Makeup eyeshadow palette from Makeup By Mario. 
                    The brush I use is the BK Beauty 204 smudge brush. This is all you need! Also, there are so many different eyeshadows that will work. 
                    As long as you have a dark color that you like and a precise brush, you can create this look!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting off, I dab my smudge brush into the desired eyeshadow, then dab it on my hand to make sure I don't have too much and I don't have too little eyeshadow. 
                    Then, I first trace along my lash line with the brush, trying to keep it as close to my eyelashes as possible. To create the wing I like, which is usually a shorter
                    smudged out line rather than a super straight and long wing, I angle my brush so the end is in line with the end of my eyebrow. This will always ensiure that the wing accentuates
                    your face, creating the look of an eye that is awake and pulled up rather than a droopy looking eye. After angling your brush to the end of your eyebrow, I then make the smallest smudge, beginning
                    at the corner of my eye, and tracing toward the end of my eyebrow. Depending on the look you want, you can make the line as short or as long as you want. It's as simple as that!
                    It may take a few practice attempts, but you should get it down in no time. Still struggling? Take a look at the video below of me completing a winged look!

                <p>
                    Want an additional tip? blend the eyeshadow to the lower lid to create an even smokier eye look! Also, <strong>when in doubt, smudge it out!</strong> If there is an mperfection in your wing, that is exactly why we use eyeshadow.
                    It is as easy as swiping your finger in the direction you want to achieve a better wing.
