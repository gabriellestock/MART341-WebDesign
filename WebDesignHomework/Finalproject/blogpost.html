                <h2>How to Perfect Your Winged Eyeliner</h2>
                <p>Are you tired of messing up your entire makeup look just because of one step? One step in the whole routine that can either <strong>absolutely</strong> make or break your entire makeup look. Would you beleive me if I told you its way easier than it looks? Probably not because I am just some random girl obsessed with makeup. But, I think you should trust me.</p>
                <p>The phrase I say is, "The best way to get the best eyeliner is to not use it at all! That may sound confusing, but its true. The only way I can ever achieve my perfect wing is when I do not use eyeliner. Now, that may be because I'm not a makeup artist and eyeliner stresses me out because its typically really hard to erase and there is little room for forgiveness. But, this is exactly why I am sitting here writing this blog. I am not here to give you unrealistic tips that only a makeup artist could complete. I am here to give you realistic tips that you can incorporate into your daily makeup routine.</p>
                <p>Now, if I don't use eyeliner, then what do I use you may ask? Eyeshadow. A product that is very forgiving but also lasts! </p>
